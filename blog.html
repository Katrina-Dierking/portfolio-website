                <p>Today should have been a great day. A joyous occasion for the books! Today,
                    I should have been welcoming my 5th child into the world. I can imagine, the 
                    room would have been filled with blue balloons, teddy-bears, and a line of
                    family members excited to hold our new additions. 
                </p>
                <p>Our seven-year old daughter would be glowing, ecstatic that her prayers 
                    had finally come true. She would shower her new brother with kisses and talk of 
                    all the things she couldn't wait to teach him.
